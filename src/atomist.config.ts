 * This sample-sdm includes code for a variety of

 *
 * The provided software delivery machines include
 *
 * Cloud Foundry full delivery (cloudFoundryMachine):
 * - sample project creation is `create spring`
 * - runs locally for the Test environment (you can change this)
 * - deploys to PCF for production (see README.md for configuration)
 *
 * Kubernetes full delivery (k8sMachine):
 * - deploys to a sandbox kubernetes environment. You don't need your own
 * - sample project creation is `create spring`
 *
 * Autofix only (autofixMachine):
 * - adds license headers to Java and TypeScript files
 *
 * Artifact checks only (artifactVerifyingMachine):
 * - builds and performs a check on Java maven artifacts
 *
 * Project creation only (projectCreationMachine):
 * - provides commands to create Java and Node projects
 *
 * Static analysis only (staticAnalysisMachine):
 * - runs Checkstyle when Java changes; reports to GitHub status
 *
 * start with any of these and change it to make it your own!
